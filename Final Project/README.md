## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

[Idea 1 - Simplified Approaches for Beginners]
<img src="/Users/tvsmith/Documents/GitHub/pui-homework-template-REAL/Final Project/final-project/images/Idea1.png" alt="first idea">

The goal is to create a user-friendly project management tool designed specifically for beginners. It simplifies task organization, progress tracking, and collaboration to help new managers who may find traditional tools overwhelming:

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging? - <i>Accessibility will be prioritized through adjustable font sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and keyboard navigation. The tool will also be compatible with screen readers, ensuring that users with different needs can effectively use the platform.</i>


### *Idea 2*
[Idea 2 - Project Milestone Tracker]
<img src="/Users/tvsmith/Documents/GitHub/pui-homework-template-REAL/Final Project/final-project/images/Idea2.png" alt="first idea">

The Project Milestone Tracker focuses on simplicity to help beginners manage their projects. The interactive timeline visually displays milestones and deadlines, making it easy to track progress without overwhelming users. Key features include customizable milestones, color-coded progress indicators, and helpful tooltips.


* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging? - <i>By featuring an intuitive timeline that visually displays milestones and deadlines, along with progress indicators to keep users motivated.</i>
…

### *Idea 3*
[Idea 3 - Project Achievements]
<img src="/Users/tvsmith/Documents/GitHub/pui-homework-template-REAL/Final Project/final-project/images/Idea3.png" alt="first idea">

The Project Achievements dashboard is designed to help beginners easily track their progress, scores, and achievements. It will feature a clean layout that clearly presents key metrics, making it simple for users to understand their project status at a glance.

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging? - <i>By using intuitive visuals like progress bars and achievement badges to keep users motivated and informed about their performance.</i>
…

## Feedback Summary

When I shared the project ideas with others, they had some concerns. For the Simplified Approaches for Beginners tool, some thought it might be too basic for users wanting advanced features. The Project Milestone Tracker raised worries about overwhelming users with too many milestones. For the Project Achievements Dashboard, a few felt some metrics might confuse beginners and that too many features could complicate things. Overall, they agreed that user feedback will be crucial for improving these tools.

## Feedback Digestion

To address the feedback, I will focus on one tool idea and simplify the visual elements of the Project Tool to avoid overwhelming users with too many milestones, making it more user-friendly for beginners.
