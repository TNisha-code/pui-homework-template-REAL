Usability Test 

I defined the main goals for the usability test. I wanted to learn how new users interacted with the tool and identify any challenges they might face. I briefed the evaluators on the overall goal of the project management tool, explaining its purpose and the key features. This included details about how users can create tasks and set priorities, helping them understand what to expect during the test.

Usability Test

Next, I selected a group of individuals who were new to project management. I wanted to ensure that their fresh perspective would provide valuable insights. Each participant was given specific tasks to complete, like creating a project task and describing the typical information that should be included. They were also asked to prioritize and filter tasks to see how easily they could navigate these features.

As they worked through these tasks, I observed their interactions closely and took notes. I encouraged participants to speak their thoughts aloud while they navigated the tool. This "think-aloud" approach was really helpful; it allowed me to understand their thought processes and pinpoint any confusion or difficulties they encountered along the way.

Feedback

After completing the tasks, I sat down with each participant to discuss their experience. I asked open-ended questions to encourage detailed feedback about what they liked, what frustrated them, and any suggestions they had for improvement. I documented all their insights, which revealed common themes and areas that need attention.

This feedback will be useful in refining the tool. By understanding how new users interact with the features and what challenges they face, we can make informed changes to enhance usability and overall user satisfaction. The goal is to create a tool that is not only functional but also intuitive and welcoming for all users.

### *Libraries and Other Components*

Evalauting JS libraries
 


## Generative AI Use Plan

As I proceed in my work to implment a Simplified Project Management Tool, I will likley leverage generative AI tools in several key ways to support my development process.

First, I will may use AI to deepen my understanding of JavaScript library implementation. While I have a foundational knowledge, there are always details and best practices that can be overlooked. By asking specific questions related to new libraries I may use, I can gain insights into more efficient ways to implement features, which will save me time and improve the overall quality of the tool.

When I encounter challenges during the refinement phase, I may turn to AI as a quick reference guide. Instead of getting stuck for long periods, I can ask specific questions about coding issues or implementation strategies that may not be working. This immediate access to information will help me maintain momentum and keep the work moving forward.

Additionally, I may use generative AI to help me find examples and resources that are relevant to my project task tool goals. If I need to understand a specific concept or functionality better, I can ask the AI to point me to tutorials, documentation, or sample code. This will be particularly useful as I want to learn more about best practices in project management tool development.

Lastly, I’m not entirely sure yet, but I may rely on AI to ensure I’m using common beginner-friendly terminology when discussing project management tools. This is important for creating an accessible and environment for new users. By checking my language and ensuring clarity, I can make the tool beginner user-friendly and meets the needs of my beginner PM audience.

Overall, incorporating generative AI tools into my implementation process will help me lear on the go, act as a support for problem-solving, and support better communication, ultimately leading to a more effective project management tool.

### *Tool Use*

ChatGPT

I will use it for quick coding questions and to clarify ideas related to JavaScript libraries. It can help me think through some issues, understand bettwe with examples, and find beginner-friendly PM resources.

I will not use it for really technical code work because it should not be used as a main source of truth as it can make mistakes. 

GitHub 

I will use it to assist with managing coding from Visual Studio. It can help me by tracking changes, and providing real-time modification heads up on my code as I write.

I will not rely on it for other trakcing needs as it can become hard to see what has changed if I bundle changes vs push code consistnantly back to my repository.

Visual Studio

I will use it for developing code, reviewing my work, and managing version control through Git. This tool is essential for writing, testing, and debugging my tool code effectively.

I will not expect it to offer guidance on project management strategies or user interface design, as it primarily focuses on code development rather than broader project process.


### *Responsible Use*

I believe using AI as a reference will be helpful for answering questions, but it's important to cross-check with other resources and gather input from other soruces. This way, I can avoid taking information at face.
